Simple Moving Average - A simple moving average (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices ( number of recent pr ices can be chose by parameter window) and then dividing that by the number of time periods in the calculation average.

Exponential Moving Average - An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. It also takes window as a parameter.

Relative Strength Index - The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.

MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

Stochastic Oscillator - A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. It is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0-100 bounded range of values.
