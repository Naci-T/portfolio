# Portfolio optimization and prediction

This project consists of two parts. The notebook portfolio_optimization_prediction.ipynb optimizes a portfolio and forecasts the future prices of this portfolio. The main portofolio optimisation.ipynb is the end product of the project but the methods in the predictions folder (predictions.ipynb, pycaret.ipynb) helped to choose the best method for the optimalisation of the project. 

## Part 1 - Portfolio optimization and prediction
### Introduction

Here comes general information about portfolio optimization (general explanation efficient frontier etc? )

### Requirements

Make requirements .txt

### Usage 
After the functions there's an example of how to use the functions. It's advised to make a new function to test
several stocks. Here is an example of how to use the functions: 
- Enter the start and end dates for which you want to get the historical stock data.
- Enter the list of stocks you want to analyze.
- Use the `optimize_portfolio` function to optimize the portfolio based on the desired method ('sharpe' or 'risk').
- Use the `info` function to see the expected annual return, annual volatility, and Sharpe ratio of the portfolio.
- Use the `number_of_stocks_to_buy` function to get the number of stocks to buy with the given investment amount.
- Use the `pie_plot` function to create a pie chart showing the distribution of the portfolio weights.

Illustration of how the output looks when you plan to invest $ 10,000 in 8 stocks:
